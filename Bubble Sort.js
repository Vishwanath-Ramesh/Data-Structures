/*Compare each and every element starting from the beginning by looping through and swap them to the left until all the elements are sorted completely*/

Eg : 8 5 2 9 5 6 3 
1. Compare 8 with 5, since 8 is greater, swap them.
2. Compare 2nd element(8) with 2, since 8 is greater, swap them.
3. Compare 3rd element(8) with 9, since 8 is smaller than 9, so move on to the next one.
4. Swap until all the elements are sorted completely.
